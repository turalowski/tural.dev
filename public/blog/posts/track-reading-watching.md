# How I Keep Track of What I Watch and Read

Hey there! Ever feel overwhelmed trying to remember all the books you want to read or movies you want to watch? I've been there. Thankfully, I found two awesome websites that help me stay organized - Goodreads and IMDb. Let me tell you how I use them.

## My Book Tracking System with Goodreads

So Goodreads is basically like Facebook for book nerds (in a good way!). I love how I can keep track of everything I read and want to read. Here's what I do:

1. **Get Started**: First things first - make a free account. Super easy.
2. **Build Your Library**: When you find a good book, just search for it and add it to your shelves. I have different ones for "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", and "Read".
3. **Share Your Thoughts**: Just finished a great book? Give it some stars and write what you thought about it. It's fun seeing if others felt the same way.
4. **Find Your Book People**: The book clubs are amazing for finding other readers who like the same stuff you do. I've found so many hidden gems this way!
5. **Challenge Yourself**: Every year I set a reading goal. It's weirdly motivating watching that progress bar fill up!

## Movie Tracking with IMDb

IMDb is my go-to for anything movie-related. Here's how I use it to never forget about those movies I want to watch:

1. **Jump In**: Quick signup, and you're ready to go.
2. **Save for Later**: Whenever someone recommends a movie, I immediately add it to my watchlist. No more forgetting titles!
3. **Rate as You Watch**: After watching something, I like to rate it. Helps me remember what I thought about it later.
4. **Find New Stuff**: I love browsing other people's movie lists. Found some real classics that way.
5. **Keep Up with Favorites**: Following your favorite actors means you'll never miss their new projects.
